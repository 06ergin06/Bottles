com.usebottles.bottles (2022.2.28-trento-3) precise; urgency=low

  * Template caching creates a copy of the first bottle created with one environment, to use it as the basis of the next one, greatly reduces creation time. Templates are regenerated when a rule changes in the default configuration of an environment, while components are still updated if new ones are installed.
  * Now it is possible to install multiple dependencies at once (really not recommended)
  * The components screen has been reorganized into groups to make it easier to navigate
  * Change DPI directly from the bottle preferences
  * The Take focus option has added to preferences, allowing the user to resume focus on app change when these hold it
  * Improved WinePrograms logs with the effective running action
  * DXVK-async is now always at the bottom of the list, preventing it from being taken by Bottles as the most recent version on bottle creation
  * Add a journal file which collect all the most important actions and events
  * The userdir/ placeholder was added allowing maintainers to reach executables from the user bottle directory
  * New bottles are now sandboxed by default, despite if running as flatpak or not (in other packages the link to the user home is simply removed)
  * Manage your virtual drives directly from the bottle preferences
  * Programs list in bottle details is now hidden if there are only hidden entries
  * Flatpak users can now generate desktop entries too if the ~/.local/share/applications path is exposed
  * General improvements to the WINE backend
  * Fixed a problem with Windows version change, was trying to set duplicate keys on registry
  * Fixed a race condition on DLL components remove and install tasks (Thanks to @asbytes)
  * Fixed a bug in command execution, the WINEPREFIX env var was not rewritten if already present in the environment
  * Fixed DLL components for 32 bit bottles (Thanks to @ffuugoo)
  * Fixed a bug in Mouse Capture Fullscreen setting which was resetting on restart
  * Fixed a bug in backup export, the backup was not aborting if the user have not picked a path
  * Fixed a bug with generated desktop entries, was setting the wrong executable path
  * Fixed a bug in layered executables support, which was unable to launch executables due to structure mismatch
  * Fixed a bug with CabExtract implementation, which was extracting resources to the wrong directory if symlink
  * Fixed a bug in layer sweep function, which was sweeping all files instead of the different ones
  * Fixed a bug in layer mount function, which was mounting the wrong directory if reading from the configuration
  * Fixed a bug in WINE command execution, which was defaulting to the bottle path instead of the layered one
  * Fixed a bug in bottles initial check, which was causing a crash if the configuration file was not found
  * Fixed programs ignored_patterns, which was allowing unins* files to be listed in programs view
  * Fixed a bug with DLL components which was not ensuring the prefix was updated before registering DLL overrides
  * Fixed winbind issue (Thanks to @arashsm79)
  * Fixed a bug with hidden programs, which were not excluded from is_alive check
