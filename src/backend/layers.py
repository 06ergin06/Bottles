class Layer:

    '''
    (WIP) This feature is not yet implemented.
    ---
    Concept:
    - bottle = Bottle.new() | create a new bottle and return its config
    - layer = Layer.new(bottle, "dotnet48") | create a new empty layer (@__dotnet48__uuid)
    - layer.mount_bottle(bottle) | link the bottle to the layer
    - Dependency.install(layer.config) | install dependency on layer
    - layer.sweep() | unlink bottle files from layer
    - layer.save() | create a index.yml file with stored files and hashes
    - layer = Layer.new(bottle, "epic") | create a new empty layer (@__epic__uuid)
    - layer.mount_bottle(bottle) | link the bottle to the layer
    - layer.mount("dotnet48") | link dotnet48 layer files to the epic layer
    - Installer.run(layer.config) | launch epic installer on layer
    - layer.sweep() | unlink dependency and bottle layers files from layer
    - layer.save() | create a index.yml file with stored files and hashes
    - bottle.add_layer_entry(..) | add a new executable to bottle Layers
    
    Notes:
    - directories are not symlinked to avoid the new layer files to be created in the bottle directory
    - layers should be able to be mounted to other layers
    - layers should remembed other mounted layers, so that they can be unlinked when unmounting
    - layers need an index.yml file to store the files and hashes
    - layers paths need a uuid to avoid collisions, format: @__<name>__<uuid>
    - bottles should store layers as by entry point (programs/executables):
        - Layers:
            - uuid
                - name: <name>
                - exec_path: <exec_path> (C:\Program Files\Epic\Epic.exe)
                - exec_args: <exec_args> (--args)
                - exec_env:
                    - <name>: <value>
                - exec_cwd: <exec_cwd> (C:\Program Files\Epic)
                - parameters:
                    - <name>: <value> (dxvk: True)
